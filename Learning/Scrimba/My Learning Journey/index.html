              Hi there! My name is Juda and welcome to my learning journal.
            </h2>
            <h3>
              After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career
              Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert
              code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded
              peers.
            </h3>

        <p class="details">
          <span class="title">How I stay committed to learning</span> I like to
          think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours
          learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or
          work new techniques into existing projects. While that was fun, I felt
          like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things
          about my journey with the world.
          <span class="title">How I got started</span> I started simple and
          gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what
          I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not
          only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what
          I learned using my own words. That helped me grok what I was learning,
          and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping
          others learn and stay motivated.
